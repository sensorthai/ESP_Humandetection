# EdgeComputing
This project aims to deploy a TensorFlow lite model into TTGO T-Camera ESP32 WROVER using Micropython. The approach is suitable for beginners willing to deploy a simple human detection model in Tensorflow lite framework. <br />
This project was based on @moclieri  https://github.com/mocleiri/tensorflow-micropython-examples.git and thanks to @uraich https://github.com/uraich/EdgeComputing/tree/main/firmware
for fixing the camera module issues presented in the recent MicroPython firmware. For more information please visit their respository.
 
# Instructions
